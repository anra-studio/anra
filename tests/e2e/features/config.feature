Feature: Manage named CLI agents in a TOML file
  People can keep their agents' settings in one file and override them with
  command flags while keeping each agent's tape separate.

  Scenario: Select a default agent or another named agent from TOML
    Given a TOML CLI configuration with Alice and Bob
    When I run the configured default agent with "hello alice"
    Then the CLI answer is "alice: hello alice"
    When I run the configured CLI agent "bob" with "hello bob"
    Then the CLI answer is "bob: hello bob"
    And the CLI agent "alice" has this conversation on its tape
      | role      | text               |
      | user      | hello alice        |
      | assistant | alice: hello alice |
    And the CLI agent "bob" has this conversation on its tape
      | role      | text           |
      | user      | hello bob      |
      | assistant | bob: hello bob |

  Scenario: Serve and send using configured agents and override a configured peer
    Given a TOML CLI configuration with Alice and Bob
    And the configured CLI agent "bob" is serving
    When the configured default agent sends "hello from alice"
    Then the CLI answer is "bob: hello from alice"
    When the configured default agent overrides its peer flag and sends "hello again"
    Then the CLI answer is "bob: hello again"
    When I stop the serving CLI agent
    Then the CLI agent "alice" has this conversation on its tape
      | role      | text                  |
      | user      | hello from alice      |
      | assistant | bob: hello from alice |
      | user      | hello again           |
      | assistant | bob: hello again      |
    And the CLI agent "bob" has this conversation on its tape
      | role      | text                  |
      | user      | hello from alice      |
      | assistant | bob: hello from alice |
      | user      | hello again           |
      | assistant | bob: hello again      |

  Scenario: An explicit storage flag overrides a configured relative directory
    Given a TOML CLI configuration with Alice and Bob
    When I run the configured default agent with an explicit storage directory
    Then the CLI answer is "alice: hello"
    And the exchange is stored only in the explicit directory
      | role      | text         |
      | user      | hello        |
      | assistant | alice: hello |

  Scenario: Override a configured session with the built-in default value
    Given a TOML CLI configuration with Alice and Bob
    And Alice's configured session is "research"
    When I run the configured default agent with "research question"
    Then the CLI answer is "alice: research question"
    When I run the configured default agent in session "default" with "fresh question"
    Then the CLI answer is "alice: fresh question"
    And the configured CLI agent "alice" has this conversation in session "research"
      | role      | text                     |
      | user      | research question        |
      | assistant | alice: research question |
    And the configured CLI agent "alice" has this conversation in session "default"
      | role      | text                  |
      | user      | fresh question        |
      | assistant | alice: fresh question |

  Scenario Outline: Reject invalid config files and respect explicit flag values
    When I run the CLI with TOML configuration problem "<problem>"
    Then the CLI command fails with "<error>"
    And no CLI tape directory is created

    Examples:
      | problem                 | error                       |
      | missing file            | read config                 |
      | malformed TOML          | parse config                |
      | wrong setting type      | parse config                |
      | unknown setting         | parse config                |
      | no agents               | at least one agent          |
      | unknown selected agent  | is not configured           |
      | unknown default agent   | is not configured           |
      | invalid agent name      | invalid agent name          |
      | invalid duration        | timeout                     |
      | explicit provider         | unknown provider             |
      | explicit zero timeout   | --timeout must be positive  |
      | explicit empty session  | --session must not be empty |
